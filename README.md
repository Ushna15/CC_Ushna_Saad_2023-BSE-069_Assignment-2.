## Project Description
This project demonstrates the deployment of a scalable and secure web architecture on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure features an Nginx Load Balancer acting as a Reverse Proxy for three Apache backend servers. Key focus areas include High Availability, SSL/TLS security, and automated system monitoring.

## Directory Structure
- main.tf              # Terraform infrastructure-as-code
- nginx.conf           # Hardened Nginx configuration (LB & Security)
- health_check.sh      # Bash script for backend monitoring
- health_log.txt       # Log file generated by the health check script
- Screenshots/         # Evidence of technical implementation
    - Failover/        # Traffic distribution and HA tests
    - Security/        # SSL Lock and Security Header grades
    - Bonus/           # Custom error pages, Rate limiting, and Logs

## Key Implementation Points
* Load Balancing: Configured Nginx to distribute traffic across backend IPs (10.0.1.101, 10.0.1.52, 10.0.1.119).
* High Availability: Verified system resilience through failover testing.
* Security Hardening: Achieved an A+ security rating using HSTS and hardened headers.
* Traffic Control: Implemented Rate Limiting (1r/s) to mitigate DDoS risks.
* Custom UX: Created branded 502 ("Server Nap") and 404 error pages.
* Automation: Developed a Bash script to audit server health and log uptime status.

## Tools Used
- Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, VPC, Security Groups)
- Provisioning: Terraform
- Web Services: Nginx (Frontend), Apache (Backend)
- Scripting: Bash (Amazon Linux 2023)
